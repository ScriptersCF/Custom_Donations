# Custom Donations

This is the source code for our Roblox donation centre, that allows you to donate any amount of Robux by prompting the user with multiple developer products that add up to the total amount the user wishes to donate.

⚠️ This code was written in 2017 and was designed for one-player servers. It is recommended to only use this for reference, rather than attempting to copy it into your own games.
